Was demo-ing project to someone else, and had some bugs I didn't know could happen (missing food group, missing product name). Added some error handling to deal with those cases, and for case that sugar_per_100g was also missing (although I haven't encounted it). Added a test to the unittesting. Reviewed vignette and other final requirements for project.
